Note: I wrote these directions for Windows, Mac may be simial though

Use: SCP can be used to easily add files to the beb server. I have to pay read money (dollars) if we exceed the free teir limits, so please limit use of this space to scripts and pages we need for this class. 

Steps to Connect:

1) Download WinSCP (http://winscp.net/eng/download.php)

2) Install WinSCP (Duh) (I recomend the command mode option [default])

3) Ensure you have the taximap.ppk key, located in this directory

4) Launch WinSCP

5) Use Following Configuration Of Session:
	File Protocol: SFTP
	Host Name: ec2-23-22-121-122.compute-1.amazonaws.com
	Port Number: 22
	User Name: ec2-user
	Password: [Leave Blank]
	Private Key: [Select the taximap.ppk key I created that is in the directory]

6) Click Login

7) For quick future use, go to Session>Save Session

8) Web Directory is in ../var/www/html
	Please don't upload files in any directory other than this
