The MySQL Database can not be connected to from outside the OSU network for security purposes (unless I add your ip address manually, something I want to avoid)

Make MySQL Query:

1) Download MySQL Workbench

2) Create new connection with following parameters:
Connection Method: Standard (TCP/IP)
hostname: taximapdb.cjjop4l4xg9o.us-east-1.rds.amazonaws.com
port: 3306
username: taximap

3) Open the connection and when prompted for a password enter 'password'
